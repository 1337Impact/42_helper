## Note : 

    As with everything in life, this product isn't perfect</br>
    Every software in this app has solved one of my problems, it will not necessarily solve one of yours, so please use what you need and leave what you don't.</br>
    This app is still in development, I'll always be adding new features. this is not everything.

## Last :
This app was time-consuming, I had to learn Python/shell scripting and go through tens of Stackoverflow pages to get what's in front of you, hope it was worth it...
Thanks ;)
